1.) Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2.) Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3.) Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

# This project encompasses:
- Data Architecture: Designing a modern data warehouse following the Medallion Architecture, incorporating Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
- ETL Pipelines: Implementing extraction, transformation, and loading processes to move data from source systems into the warehouse.
- Data Modeling: Building fact and dimension tables tailored for efficient analytical querying.
- Analytics & Reporting: Developing SQL-based reports and dashboards to deliver meaningful, actionable insights.

# Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Objective:
Design and implement a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to unify sales data from multiple systems, supporting analytical reporting and informed business decisions.

Specifications:
- Data Sources: Load and integrate data from two CSV-based systemsâ€”ERP and CRM.
- Data Quality: Perform data cleansing to address and resolve quality issues before analysis.
- Integration: Merge both sources into a cohesive, user-friendly data model optimized for analytical queries.
- Scope: Work exclusively with the most recent dataset; historical tracking is not required.
- Documentation: Deliver comprehensive data model documentation for both business users and analytics teams.
